Yes — you can absolutely run Rhasspy locally and configure it to call your own **local HTTP webhook endpoint**, such as one served by an Express.js server running on the same machine.

### 🔧 How to set up Rhasspy with a local HTTP webhook

#### 1. **Enable “Remote” intent handling in Rhasspy profile**

In your Rhasspy profile's `profile.json`, add a `"remote"` handle configuration like this:

```json
"handle": {
  "system": "remote",
  "remote": {
    "url": "http://localhost:3000/your_intent_endpoint"
  }
}
```

With this setting, Rhasspy will `POST` the recognized intent JSON to your local Express.js endpoint when a voice command is processed — no internet required. ([rhasspy.readthedocs.io][1], [rhasspy.readthedocs.io][2])

#### 2. **Install and run `rhasspy-remote-http-hermes`**

This is the tool that allows Rhasspy to send intents via HTTP instead of MQTT:

```bash
pip3 install rhasspy-remote-http-hermes
# or clone + build from GitHub
```

Run it with CLI options specifying your local Rhasspy and webhook URLs:

```bash
rhasspy-remote-http-hermes \
  --asr-url http://localhost:12101/api/speech-to-text \
  --nlu-url http://localhost:12101/api/text-to-intent \
  --tts-url http://localhost:12101/api/text-to-speech \
  --handle-url http://localhost:3000/your_intent_endpoint
```

You may also use the `--webhook` option to pair topics/URLs. ([github.com][3])

#### 3. **Build your Express.js webhook endpoint**

Here’s a simple example server:

```js
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post('/your_intent_endpoint', (req, res) => {
  console.log('Intent received:', req.body.intent?.name, req.body.slots);
  // Your logic here: trigger actions, run scripts, etc.

  res.json({ speech: { text: "OK, done!" } });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Webhook listening on port 3000'));
```

Rhasspy will speak the returned `speech.text` (if using a TTS system configured) after your endpoint responds. ([rhasspy.readthedocs.io][2])

### ✅ Summary: Local HTTP webhook flow

| Step                         | Behavior                                           |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Rhasspy detect → intent      | Intent recognized                                  |
| `rhasspy-remote-http-hermes` | Collects ASR + NLU + TTS URLs                      |
| Handle via HTTP              | Sends recognized JSON to local Express endpoint    |
| Your Express app             | Executes action and returns optional `speech` text |
| Rhasspy TTS                  | Speaks the response if TTS system is configured    |

Everything can run on your local Ubuntu machine without any cloud dependencies.

### 🧩 Next steps...

Would you like help with:

* A full `profile.json` example and Docker vs native install?
* Adding slot parsing and dynamic reply templates?
* Combining this with wake-word detection and speech streaming?

I’d be glad to tailor a full working example for your setup!
