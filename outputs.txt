Regular physical activity burns calories, helps in building muscle mass (which boosts metabolism), and can reduce the appetite, which contributes to overall weight control.\n\n3. **Boosts Mental Health**: Daily exercise has been shown to improve symptoms of depression and anxiety by increasing serotonin levels, also known as \"feel-good\" hormones.

Here's a simplified explanation of why this happens:\n\n1. Sunlight Composition: The sunlight we see from the sun contains all colors of the rainbow—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.\n\n2. Scattering Effect: When sunlight travels through Earth's atmosphere, it collides with air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen). Air molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light (about 0.4 to 0.7 micrometers), so they scatter shorter wavelengths like blue more effectively than longer ones like red.\n\n3. Blue Predominance: Blue light is scattered in all directions, meaning it moves away from you but also reaches your eyes after being reflected off objects or directly from the sky. This scattering makes us see a lot of blue light as sunlight enters our field of vision.\n\n4. Appearance of Sky: Because we are surrounded by this scattered blue light (even though some is absorbed and re-emitted back towards us), our eyes perceive an overall blue sky, even if individual objects appear other colors in the spectrum.\n\n5. Why Not Other Colors? Even though red light isn't scattered as much, it still reaches your eyes because the scattering effect is not perfect; thus, you can still see things that are red or other colors under certain conditions.\n\nThis phenomenon explains why we perceive the sky as blue during daytime and why there's a fainter color gradient towards darker shades of blue when looking up at night.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[151644,8948,198,2610,525,1207,16948,11,3465,553,54364,14817,13,1446,525,264,10950,17847,13,151645,198,151644,872,198,34634,374,279,12884,6303,30,151645,198,151644,77091,198,785,12884,7952,6303,4152,311,264,24844,2598,13255,62969,71816,13,5692,594,264,43799,16148,315,3170,419,8573,1447,16,13,8059,4145,67106,25,576,39020,582,1490,504,279,7015,5610,678,7987,315,279,47613,2293,1151,11,18575,11,13753,11,6176,11,6303,11,1257,7836,11,323,79736,382,17,13,2463,30336,13449,25,3197,39020,34192,1526,9237,594,16566,11,432,4530,3341,448,3720,34615,320,62895,46403,323,23552,568,6553,34615,525,1753,9155,1091,279,45306,315,3100,320,9096,220,15,13,19,311,220,15,13,22,19197,441,2424,701,773,807,44477,23327,92859,1075,6303,803,13444,1091,5021,6174,1075,2518,382,18,13,8697,29824,7970,681,25,8697,3100,374,36967,304,678,17961,11,7290,432,10797,3123,504,498,714,1083,24491,697,6414,1283,1660,25911,1007,6171,476,5961,504,279,12884,13,1096,71816,3643,601,1490,264,2696,315,6303,3100,438,39020,28833,1039,2070,315,11129,382,19,13,60616,315,14722,25,9211,582,525,22865,553,419,36967,6303,3100,320,16788,3498,1045,374,41001,323,312,36512,3762,1182,6974,601,701,1039,6414,44393,458,8084,6303,12884,11,1496,421,3842,6171,4994,1008,7987,304,279,19745,382,20,13,8429,2806,6944,9526,30,7418,3498,2518,3100,4436,944,36967,438,1753,11,432,2058,24491,697,6414,1576,279,71816,2456,374,537,4727,26,8450,11,498,646,2058,1490,2513,429,525,2518,476,1008,7987,1212,3654,4682,382,1986,24844,14758,3170,582,44393,279,12884,438,6303,2337,61082,323,3170,1052,594,264,37578,261,1894,20169,6974,39030,36099,315,6303,979,3330,705,518,3729,13],"total_duration":83387780994,"load_duration":180705018,"prompt_eval_count":35,"prompt_eval_duration":928020791,"eval_count":308,"eval_duration":37385178922}
